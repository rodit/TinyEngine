# TinyEngine
A map editor and game development tool for tile-based RPG games (such as [TinyRPG](https://github.com/rodit/TinyRPG)).

This tool can be used to design and export maps, items, locale definitions and much more for 2D tile-based RPG game development.

## Main Features

### Tile Based Map Editor
Import tilesets from any image and paint them in layers to design any kind of level.

Entities can be added and linked to scripts which handle player interaction. Sprites and bitmaps can be packed into a map and used to render entities in game.

Maps can then be previewed with lighting calculated and bounding boxes hidden.
